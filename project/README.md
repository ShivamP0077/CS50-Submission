## Introduction

Wordle Clone is a recreation of the classic word-guessing game Wordle. Test your vocabulary and logical thinking as you try to guess the secret word within a limited number of attempts.

## Features

- Randomly generated secret word for each game.
- Limited attempts to guess the word.
- Feedback on guessed letters (correct, incorrect, or in the wrong position).
  - **Green**: A guessed letter is in the correct position in the secret word.
  - **Yellow**: A guessed letter is in the secret word, but it's not in the correct position.
  - **Grey**: A guessed letter is not in the secret word.

## Gameplay

1. **Objective**: The main goal of Wordle Clone is to guess the secret word within a limited number of attempts.

2. **Getting Started**: When you start a new game, a random secret word is generated for you. This word is typically between 5 to 8 letters long and is composed of uppercase English letters.

3. **Guessing**: You have a limited number of attempts (usually 6) to guess the secret word. On each attempt, you provide a word guess that you think might be the secret word.

4. **Feedback**: After each guess, you will receive feedback on your guessed letters:
   - **Green**: A guessed letter is in the correct position in the secret word.
   - **Yellow**: A guessed letter is in the secret word, but it's not in the correct position.
   - **Grey**: A guessed letter is not in the secret word at all.

5. **Using Feedback**: Utilize the feedback you receive after each guess to refine your subsequent guesses. As you gather more information about which letters are correct and their positions, you can gradually narrow down the possibilities.

6. **Strategy and Logic**: Wordle Clone requires a combination of vocabulary skills, logical thinking, and deduction. As the game progresses, use the feedback strategically to eliminate unlikely letters and focus on potential candidates.

7. **Winning and Losing**: You win the game if you successfully guess the secret word within the allowed number of attempts. However, if you exhaust all your attempts without guessing the correct word, you lose the game.

## How to Play

1. **Input**: At the beginning of each attempt, you provide a word guess consisting of 5 to 8 uppercase English letters.

2. **Feedback Interpretation**: Understand the feedback you receive for each guessed letter:
   - Green: Correct letter in the correct position.
   - Yellow: Correct letter, but in the wrong position.
   - Grey: Incorrect letter.

3. **Adjusting Strategy**: Based on the feedback, adjust your strategy for the next guess. Eliminate incorrect letters and positions and focus on potential matches.

4. **Multiple Rounds**: You can play multiple rounds of Wordle Clone, each with a different randomly generated secret word.

5. **Enjoy and Learn**: Wordle Clone is not only a fun word-guessing game but also a way to expand your vocabulary and enhance your logical thinking skills.
